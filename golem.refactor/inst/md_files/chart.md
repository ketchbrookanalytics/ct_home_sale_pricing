The chart seen in the application is produced via a technique called "LIME", which stands for "Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations". The original paper citing the methodology can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938). This techique fits a linear model through the given observation, then looks at the nearest (hence, "Local") data points around that particular observation to gauge how the model performs at those other points in the vicinity compared to the observation at hand.
